# üèòÔ∏è SocialMapper: Explore Community Connections.

SocialMapper is an open-source Python toolkit that helps you understand how people connect with the important places in their community. Imagine taking a key spot like your local shopping center or school and seeing exactly what areas are within a certain travel time ‚Äì whether it's a quick walk or a longer drive. SocialMapper does just that.

But it doesn't stop at travel time. SocialMapper also shows you the characteristics of the people who live within these accessible areas, like how many people live there and what the average income is. This helps you see who can easily reach vital community resources and identify any gaps in access.

Whether you're looking at bustling city neighborhoods or more spread-out rural areas, SocialMapper provides clear insights for making communities better, planning services, and ensuring everyone has good access to the places that matter.

With plans to expand and explore our connection to the natural world, SocialMapper is a tool for understanding people, places, and the environment around us.

## Creating Your Own Community Maps: Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Define Your Points of Interest

You can specify points of interest either through the interactive Streamlit dashboard or with direct command-line parameters.

#### Option A: Using the Streamlit Dashboard (Recommended)

The easiest way to create maps is to use the Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

This provides an interactive interface where you can:
- Select POI types and names from dropdown menus
- Choose your location and state
- Set travel time and census variables
- View results in a user-friendly format

#### Option B: Command Line with Direct Parameters

You can run the tool directly with POI parameters:

```bash
python community_mapper.py --poi --geocode-area "Fuquay-Varina" --state "North Carolina" --poi-type "amenity" --poi-name "library" --travel-time 15 --census-variables total_population median_household_income
```

### POI Types and Names Reference

Regardless of which method you use, you'll need to specify POI types and names. Common OpenStreetMap POI combinations:

- Libraries: `poi-type: "amenity"`, `poi-name: "library"`
- Schools: `poi-type: "amenity"`, `poi-name: "school"`
- Hospitals: `poi-type: "amenity"`, `poi-name: "hospital"`
- Parks: `poi-type: "leisure"`, `poi-name: "park"`
- Supermarkets: `poi-type: "shop"`, `poi-name: "supermarket"`
- Pharmacies: `poi-type: "amenity"`, `poi-name: "pharmacy"`

Check out the OpenStreetMap Wiki for more on map features: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features

For more specific queries, you can add additional tags (through the Streamlit interface or in a YAML format with command-line):
```yaml
# Example tags (can be specified in the Streamlit interface):
operator: Chicago Park District
opening_hours: 24/7
```

### 2. Choose Your Target States

If you're using direct POI parameters, you should provide the state where your analysis should occur. This ensures accurate census data selection.

For areas near state borders or POIs spread across multiple states, you don't need to do anything special - the tool will automatically identify the appropriate census data.

### 3. Select Demographics to Analyze

Choose which census variables you want to analyze. Some useful options:

### 4. Run the Community Mapper

#### Using the Streamlit Dashboard

The simplest way to run the Community Mapper is through the Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

#### Using Direct POI Parameters

Run directly with POI parameters:

```bash
python community_mapper.py --poi --geocode-area "Chicago" --state "Illinois" --poi-type "amenity" --poi-name "library" --travel-time 15 --census-variables total_population
```

By default, census data is exported to CSV format. To disable this feature, use:

```bash
python community_mapper.py --poi --geocode-area "Chicago" --state "Illinois" --poi-type "amenity" --poi-name "library" --no-export
```

#### Using Your Own Coordinates

If you already have latitude/longitude coordinates, you can skip the POI query step by providing your own CSV or JSON file. 

```bash
python community_mapper.py --custom-coords examples/custom_coordinates.csv --travel-time 15 --census-variables total_population
```

Supported formats for custom POIs:

1. CSV with header row:
```
id,name,lat,lon,state,type
1,"Community Center",37.7749,-122.4194,public
2,"Food Bank",37.7833,-122.4167,nonprofit
```

2. JSON list format:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Community Center",
    "lat": 37.7749,
    "lon": -122.4194,
    "state": "CA",
    "tags": {
      "type": "public"
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    "name": "Food Bank",
    "lat": 37.7833,
    "lon": -122.4167,
    "state": "CA",
    "tags": {
      "type": "nonprofit"
    }
  }
]
```

Parameters explained:
- `--poi`: Use direct POI parameters mode
- `--geocode-area`: Area/city to search within
- `--poi-type`: Type of POI from OpenStreetMap (e.g., "amenity", "leisure")
- `--poi-name`: Name of POI from OpenStreetMap (e.g., "library", "park")
- `--custom-coords`: Path to your custom coordinates CSV or JSON file
- `--travel-time`: Travel time in minutes (how far can people travel from each POI)
- `--census-variables`: Census data to retrieve (list the variables you want)
- `--export`: Export census data to CSV (default: enabled)
- `--no-export`: Disable exporting census data to CSV format

### 5. Analyze the Results

After running the script, you'll find several outputs in the `output/` directory:
- GeoJSON files with isochrones in `output/isochrones/`
- GeoJSON files with block groups in `output/block_groups/`
- GeoJSON files with census data in `output/census_data/`
- PNG map visualizations in `output/maps/`
- CSV files with census data and travel distances in `output/csv/`

The maps show each demographic variable for the areas within your specified travel time of the POIs.

The CSV files include:
- Census block group identifiers
- County and state FIPS codes
- Percentage of each block group area within the travel time area
- All selected census variables
- Travel distance (in kilometers) from each block group's centroid to the nearest POI

These CSV exports are ideal for further analysis in tools like Excel, R, or other statistical software.

### Example Projects

Here are some examples of community mapping projects you could create:

1. **Food Desert Analysis**: Map supermarkets with travel times and income data to identify areas with limited food access.
   ```bash
   python community_mapper.py --poi --geocode-area "Chicago" --state "Illinois" --poi-type "shop" --poi-name "supermarket" --travel-time 20 --census-variables total_population median_household_income
   ```

2. **Healthcare Access**: Map hospitals and clinics with population and age demographics.
   ```bash
   python community_mapper.py --poi --geocode-area "Los Angeles" --state "California" --poi-type "amenity" --poi-name "hospital" --travel-time 30 --census-variables total_population median_age
   ```

3. **Educational Resource Distribution**: Map schools and libraries with educational attainment data.
   ```bash
   python community_mapper.py --poi --geocode-area "Boston" --state "Massachusetts" --poi-type "amenity" --poi-name "school" --travel-time 15 --census-variables total_population education_bachelors_plus
   ```

4. **Park Access Equity**: Map parks with demographic and income data to assess equitable access.
   ```bash
   python community_mapper.py --poi --geocode-area "Miami" --state "Florida" --poi-type "leisure" --poi-name "park" --travel-time 10 --census-variables total_population median_household_income white_population black_population
   ```

### Troubleshooting

- **No POIs found**: Check your POI configuration. Try making the query more general or verify that the location name is correct.
- **Census API errors**: Ensure your API key is valid and properly set as an environment variable.
- **Isochrone generation issues**: For very large areas, try reducing the travel time to avoid timeouts.
- **Missing block groups**: The tool should automatically identify the appropriate states based on the POI locations.
