# Walmart Locations Analysis in NRCS Conservation Study Area

## Overview
This report analyzes the consolidated Walmart store location data collected for the NRCS Conservation Study Area project. The dataset contains 549 Walmart locations across 8 states, focusing primarily on Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Wyoming, and South Dakota.

## Geographical Distribution

### State Distribution
The Walmart locations are distributed across states as follows:

| State | Number of Stores | Percentage |
|-------|------------------|------------|
| TX    | 288              | 52.5%      |
| OK    | 66               | 12.0%      |
| CO    | 66               | 12.0%      |
| KS    | 31               | 5.6%       |
| NE    | 20               | 3.6%       |
| NM    | 14               | 2.5%       |
| WY    | 4                | 0.7%       |
| SD    | 2                | 0.4%       |
| N/A   | 58               | 10.6%      |

**Key Insight**: Texas dominates the distribution with over half of all Walmart locations in the study area, which aligns with its larger geographic area and population within the study region.

### City Distribution
The top 10 cities with the most Walmart locations are:

1. San Antonio, TX: 29 stores
2. Oklahoma City, OK: 14 stores
3. Fort Worth, TX: 14 stores
4. Dallas, TX: 12 stores
5. Plano, TX: 9 stores
6. El Paso, TX: 8 stores
7. Colorado Springs, CO: 8 stores
8. Wichita, KS: 8 stores
9. Lubbock, TX: 7 stores
10. Arlington, TX: 6 stores

**Key Insight**: Urban areas have significantly higher concentration of Walmart locations, with San Antonio having more than twice the number of stores compared to most other major cities in the region.

### Geographical Range
The dataset covers locations within the following geographical boundaries:
- Latitude: 28.4221째 to 42.9074째 (North)
- Longitude: -106.3936째 to -96.5744째 (West)

This coverage spans from South Texas to central South Dakota, encompassing the Great Plains region.

## Store Characteristics

### Store Types
The Walmart locations are classified by their physical representation in OpenStreetMap:

| Type | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| way  | 472   | Stores represented as building outlines |
| node | 77    | Stores represented as single point locations |

**Key Insight**: The majority of stores (86%) are mapped as physical building outlines, indicating good data quality in the OpenStreetMap source.

### Services Provided
Walmart locations offer various combinations of services:

| Service Type | Count | Percentage |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| Supercenter  | 325   | 59.2%      |
| Neighborhood Market | 103 | 18.8% |
| General Store + Supercenter | 61 | 11.1% |
| General Store only | 38 | 6.9% |
| Other combinations | 22 | 4.0% |

**Key Insight**: Supercenters dominate the Walmart presence in the study area, accounting for nearly 60% of all locations. These larger format stores typically offer a full grocery section, general merchandise, and often additional services.

## Operational Characteristics

### Operating Hours
- 88.2% of locations have operating hours information available
- 250 stores (51.7% of those with hours data) operate 24/7
- Most non-24/7 locations typically operate between 6:00 AM and 11:00 PM or midnight

**Key Insight**: Over half of the Walmart stores with hours information operate continuously, providing constant access to retail and grocery services in their communities.

### Data Completeness
- 90.2% of locations have complete address information
- 88.2% have operating hours data
- All locations have latitude/longitude coordinates

**Key Insight**: The dataset is fairly complete, with high-quality location data and good coverage of key attributes, making it suitable for spatial analysis within the conservation study area.

## Implications for Conservation Planning

The distribution of Walmart stores can serve as a proxy for:

1. **Population density and development patterns**: The concentration of stores in urban areas helps identify population centers
2. **Commercial development pressure**: Areas with multiple stores may indicate higher development pressure on natural resources
3. **Rural access to services**: The presence of Walmart stores in smaller communities may influence rural development patterns
4. **Transportation corridors**: Stores tend to cluster along major transportation routes, which can impact wildlife corridors

This analysis provides valuable context for NRCS conservation planning by highlighting the retail infrastructure footprint across the study area and identifying regions where commercial development may interact with conservation priorities.
