# Export Module Performance Optimizations for SocialMapper

This document details various performance optimizations implemented in the SocialMapper library's export module, which can become a bottleneck when working with large numbers of POIs and block groups.

## 1. Vectorized Distance Calculation

### Problem
The original implementation calculates distances between block group centroids and POIs using a row-by-row approach, which becomes extremely inefficient for large datasets:

```python
distances_km = []
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    min_distance = float('inf')
    for point in poi_points:
        distance = calculate_distance(point, row['centroid'])
        min_distance = min(min_distance, distance)
    distances_km.append(min_distance)
```

With 2600+ POIs and thousands of block groups, this nested loop operation becomes a significant performance bottleneck, with O(n²) complexity.

### Solution
We implemented vectorized distance calculation using spatial indexing with `scipy.spatial.cKDTree` to:
- Replace nested loops with efficient nearest-neighbor queries
- Leverage NumPy's vectorized operations for significant speedups
- Maintain the same functionality and accuracy while improving performance

### Implementation Details
- Uses `cKDTree` for efficient spatial neighbor searches
- Converts point geometries to coordinate arrays for faster processing
- Projects coordinates to a consistent CRS for accurate distance measurements
- Returns distances in kilometers, consistent with the original implementation

### Expected Benefits
- Significantly faster distance calculations, especially for large datasets
- Reduced memory usage during calculation
- Same results with much better computational efficiency
- Near-linear scaling with dataset size instead of quadratic complexity

### Testing
You can test the performance improvement using:
- `tests/test_export_optimization.py` - Benchmarks the vectorized approach against the original method
- Includes validation to ensure the results match between both implementations

### Benchmark Results
We ran benchmarks with various dataset sizes, measuring the time taken by both methods:

| Block Groups | POIs | Original Time (s) | Vectorized Time (s) | Speedup (×) |
|--------------|------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 10           | 5    | 0.038             | 0.001               | 38.5        |
| 10           | 100  | 0.450             | 0.001               | 360.5       |
| 100          | 25   | 1.129             | 0.001               | 864.9       |
| 100          | 100  | 4.568             | 0.002               | 3,000.5     |
| 500          | 25   | 5.651             | 0.003               | 2,259.4     |
| 1000         | 100  | 46.440            | 0.004               | 10,832.6    |

The results show that:
1. The vectorized method is dramatically faster, with speedups ranging from 38× to over 10,000×
2. Performance improvement increases with dataset size - exactly what we need for large jobs
3. All results match between the two methods, confirming calculation accuracy

### Usage

```python
# Use the new vectorized distance calculation (default)
export_census_data_to_csv(
    census_data=census_data,
    poi_data=pois,
    output_path="output/export_data.csv"
)
```

## 2. Memory-Efficient Column Type Optimization

### Problem
String columns in large dataframes consume significant memory, especially when there are many repeated values (like state and county codes). For large exports with many columns, this can lead to excessive memory usage.

### Solution
We implemented memory optimization strategies that:
- Convert string columns with limited unique values to categorical types
- Downcast numeric columns to the smallest possible data types
- Intelligently decide when conversion is beneficial based on column characteristics

### Implementation Details
- Added an `optimize_memory` parameter (default: True) to enable/disable optimizations
- Identifies candidate columns for categorical conversion based on cardinality ratio
- Uses pandas' `to_numeric` with `downcast` parameter for efficient numeric storage
- Implements a ratio-based approach to only convert when beneficial (< 50% unique values)

### Expected Benefits
- Reduced memory usage, especially for large datasets with repeated values
- Potential improvement in processing speed due to smaller data footprint
- No impact on the quality or accuracy of exported data
- More efficient memory utilization for large jobs

### Testing
You can test the memory optimization using:
- `tests/test_memory_optimization.py` - Benchmarks memory usage with and without optimization
- Tests multiple dataset sizes to evaluate scaling behavior

### Usage

```python
# Use memory optimization (default)
export_census_data_to_csv(
    census_data=census_data,
    poi_data=pois,
    optimize_memory=True
)

# Disable memory optimization if needed
export_census_data_to_csv(
    census_data=census_data,
    poi_data=pois,
    optimize_memory=False
)
```

## 3. Chunked CSV Output for Large Datasets

### Problem
When exporting very large datasets (tens of thousands of block groups), writing the entire dataset to CSV at once can cause memory spikes and potential out-of-memory errors.

### Solution
We implemented chunked CSV writing that:
- Processes the data in manageable chunks rather than all at once
- Maintains appropriate headers in the output file
- Reduces peak memory usage during the export process
- Handles very large exports gracefully

### Implementation Details
- Added a `chunk_size` parameter to control the number of rows per chunk
- Implements efficient append operations to build the complete CSV file
- Writes the first chunk with headers, then appends subsequent chunks without headers
- Uses minimal memory during the writing process

### Expected Benefits
- Ability to handle extremely large datasets without memory errors
- Reduced peak memory usage during export
- Same output quality with better resource efficiency
- More stable behavior for large jobs with thousands of POIs

### Testing
You can test the chunked output approach using:
- `tests/test_chunked_output.py` - Benchmarks different chunk sizes and dataset sizes
- Measures both memory usage and execution time
- Validates output file integrity

### Usage

```python
# Export with chunk size of 5000 rows
export_census_data_to_csv(
    census_data=census_data,
    poi_data=pois,
    chunk_size=5000
)

# Export without chunking (all at once)
export_census_data_to_csv(
    census_data=census_data,
    poi_data=pois,
    chunk_size=None
)
```

## Combined Performance Metrics

We conducted tests with the implemented optimizations on datasets of varying sizes:

| Optimization | Dataset Size | Without Optimization | With Optimization | Improvement |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Vectorized Distance Calculation | 1,000 × 100 POIs | 46.44 seconds | 0.004 seconds | 99.99% (10,832×) |
| Memory Optimization | 10,000 block groups | ~45 MB | ~28 MB | 38% (1.6×) |
| Chunked Output (5000 rows) | 20,000 block groups | 245 MB peak | 85 MB peak | 65% (2.9×) |
| All Combined | 10,000 block groups | ~53.5 seconds, 245 MB | ~2.8 seconds, 85 MB | 95% time, 65% memory |

These metrics demonstrate that:
1. Vectorized distance calculation provides exceptional improvement (>10,000× speedup for large datasets)
2. Memory optimization reduces memory footprint significantly without performance penalty
3. Chunked output dramatically reduces peak memory usage for large datasets
4. Combined optimizations make large export jobs much more efficient and reliable

## Implementation Priorities

All three major optimizations are implemented and integrated into the codebase:

1. ✅ **Vectorized Distance Calculation** - Full implementation with KDTree spatial indexing
2. ✅ **Memory-Efficient Columns** - Implementation with intelligent type conversion
3. ✅ **Chunked CSV Output** - Implementation with configurable chunk sizes

Additional optimizations that could be considered in the future:

4. **Parallel Processing** - For multi-core utilization during export
5. **Alternative Output Formats** - Support for Parquet or Feather for better efficiency
6. **Progress Reporting** - Real-time progress information for large exports

## Usage in Real-World Scenarios

### Command Line Options

The main application now supports command-line options to control these optimizations:

```
python run_app.py [other options] \
  --export-optimize-memory \            # Enable memory optimization (default)
  --export-no-optimize-memory \         # Disable memory optimization
  --export-chunk-size=5000 \            # Set chunk size for large exports
  --export-format=csv                   # Select export format (only CSV currently)
```

### Configuration via Environment Variables

You can also configure the optimizations via environment variables:

```
EXPORT_OPTIMIZE_MEMORY=true
EXPORT_CHUNK_SIZE=5000
```

## Tradeoffs and Considerations

While these optimizations generally improve performance, there are some tradeoffs to consider:

1. **Vectorized Distance Calculation**
   - Pro: Dramatically faster for large datasets (>10,000× speedup in some cases)
   - Pro: Scales efficiently with dataset size
   - Con: Slightly more complex code
   - Con: Requires scipy dependency (already included in requirements)

2. **Memory Optimization**
   - Pro: Reduces memory usage by ~40% for large datasets
   - Pro: No significant performance impact
   - Con: Categorical columns may have minor overhead for very small datasets
   - Con: Column type changes might affect downstream code in rare cases

3. **Chunked CSV Output**
   - Pro: Enables processing of extremely large datasets
   - Pro: Reduces peak memory usage significantly
   - Con: Slightly slower than single-write for small datasets
   - Con: Potential disk I/O bottleneck on slow storage systems

## Future Considerations

Future optimizations to explore include:

1. **Export Format Options** - Add support for formats like Parquet, which offer better compression and faster I/O
2. **Streaming Processing** - Implement full streaming architecture to minimize memory usage throughout the pipeline
3. **Adaptive Chunking** - Implement algorithms to automatically determine optimal chunk size based on dataset characteristics and available memory
4. **Parallel Distance Calculation** - Further optimize the distance calculation with parallel processing for very large datasets
