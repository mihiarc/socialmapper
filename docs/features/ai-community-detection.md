# AI-Powered Community Boundary Detection

SocialMapper now includes cutting-edge AI capabilities for automatically detecting organic community boundaries based on spatial patterns, building arrangements, and environmental features. This moves beyond traditional administrative boundaries to discover how communities actually exist in the real world.

## Overview

Traditional geographic boundaries (census tracts, ZIP codes, city limits) often don't align with how people actually experience community. A housing development, a neighborhood with similar architectural styles, or areas connected by walkways might be more meaningful community units.

Our AI-powered approach uses multiple signals to discover these organic boundaries:

- **Spatial Patterns**: Building footprints, road networks, architectural similarity
- **Computer Vision**: Satellite imagery analysis for land use classification
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Advanced machine learning to identify coherent groups
- **Network Analysis**: Spatial relationships and connectivity patterns

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Modal Analysis
- **Building Pattern Recognition**: Detects planned developments, suburban clusters, rural settlements
- **Satellite Image Analysis**: Land use classification from aerial imagery  
- **Demographic Validation**: Ensures detected boundaries align with population characteristics
- **Infrastructure Awareness**: Considers roads, water bodies, and natural barriers

### 2. Advanced Algorithms
- **HDBSCAN**: Density-based clustering for irregular shapes
- **Gaussian Mixture Models**: Probabilistic modeling of community structures
- **Spectral Clustering**: Graph-based community detection
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combines multiple approaches for robust results

### 3. Intelligent Boundary Generation
- **Alpha Shapes**: Creates realistic, non-convex boundaries
- **Spatial Contiguity**: Ensures communities are spatially connected
- **Multi-Scale Detection**: Finds communities at different geographic scales
- **Noise Handling**: Distinguishes systematic patterns from random variations

## Technical Architecture

```python
# Example workflow
from socialmapper.community import discover_community_boundaries

# 1. Load building footprints
buildings = load_building_data(study_area)

# 2. Optional: Add satellite imagery
satellite_image = "path/to/high_res_imagery.tif"

# 3. Optional: Include demographic data
demographics = load_census_data(study_area)

# 4. Discover organic communities
boundaries = discover_community_boundaries(
    buildings_gdf=buildings,
    satellite_image=satellite_image,
    demographic_data=demographics,
    method='ensemble'  # or 'hdbscan', 'gmm', 'spectral'
)

# 5. Validate and export
validated_boundaries = validate_boundaries_with_demographics(
    boundaries, demographics
)
```
