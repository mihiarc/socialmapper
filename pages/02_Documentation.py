# System Architecture
st.header("System Architecture")
st.markdown("""
The SocialMapper follows a pipeline architecture where each component builds on the output of the previous one:

1. **POI Query**: Obtains Points of Interest (POIs) from OpenStreetMap or custom coordinates
2. **Isochrone Generation**: Creates travel time polygons around each POI
3. **Block Group Identification**: Finds census block groups that intersect with isochrones
4. **Census Data Retrieval**: Gets demographic data for those block groups
5. **Map Visualization**: Generates maps showing the demographic data

    ### POI Query Module
    
    This module is responsible for obtaining Points of Interest (POIs) data:
    
    - **OpenStreetMap Queries**: Uses the Overpass API to find POIs based on tags
    - **Custom Coordinates**: Allows users to provide their own coordinates in CSV or JSON format
    
    #### Supported POI Types from OpenStreetMap:
    
    | Type | Examples | OSM Tags |
    |------|----------|----------|
    | Amenities | Libraries, Schools, Hospitals | `amenity=library`, `amenity=school`, `amenity=hospital` |
    | Leisure | Parks, Sports Centers | `leisure=park`, `leisure=sports_centre` |
    | Shops | Supermarkets, Pharmacies | `shop=supermarket`, `shop=pharmacy` |
    | Healthcare | Clinics, Doctors | `healthcare=doctor`, `healthcare=clinic` |
    
    #### Requirements for Custom Coordinates:
    
    Custom coordinates must include latitude, longitude, and state information for each point.

    ### Isochrone Module
    
    This module generates travel time polygons around each POI:
    
    - Uses the OpenStreetMap network to calculate travel times
    - Supports different travel modes (walking, driving, cycling)
    - Creates polygon geometries representing areas reachable within the specified travel time
    
    #### Parameters:
    
    - **Travel Time**: Specified in minutes (typically 5-60 minutes)
    - **Travel Mode**: How people travel (walking, driving, cycling)
    - **Network Type**: Road network characteristics
    
    The isochrones are generated using the OSMnx library, which interfaces with the OpenStreetMap network.

    ### Block Group Module
    
    This module identifies census block groups that intersect with the isochrones:
    
    - Downloads block group geometries from the Census Bureau
    - Performs spatial joins to find which block groups intersect with isochrones
    - Calculates the proportion of each block group that falls within the isochrone
    
    Census block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the Census Bureau publishes sample data.

    ### Census Data Module
    
    This module retrieves demographic data for the identified block groups:

    - Supports various demographic variables (population, income, education, etc.)
    - Aggregates data based on the proportion of block groups within isochrones

    | Total Population | total_population | B01003_001E |

    This module generates maps showing the demographic data:

    #### Map Features:

    - Color-coded block groups based on demographic variables
    - POI markers with labels
    - Scale bar and north arrow
    - Legend explaining the color scale

    ### Data Export Module
    
    This module exports census data to CSV format for further analysis:
    
    - Exports all selected census variables for each block group
    - Includes geographic identifiers (block group ID, county FIPS, state FIPS)
    - Calculates and includes travel distances in both kilometers and miles
    - Uses human-readable but standardized names (lowercase with underscores)
    
    #### CSV File Structure:
    
    | Column | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | census_block_group | Census Block Group GEOID (12-digit identifier) |
    | state_fips | State FIPS code (2-digit identifier) |
    | county_fips | County FIPS code (5-digit identifier) |
    | tract | Census tract component of the GEOID |
    | block_group | Block group component of the GEOID |
    | poi_id | ID of the point of interest |
    | poi_name | Name of the point of interest |
    | travel_time_minutes | Travel time limit in minutes |
    | avg_travel_speed_kmh | Average travel speed used in isochrone calculations (kilometers per hour) |
    | avg_travel_speed_mph | Average travel speed used in isochrone calculations (miles per hour) |
    | travel_distance_km | Distance in kilometers from block group centroid to nearest POI |
    | travel_distance_miles | Distance in miles from block group centroid to nearest POI |
    | area_within_travel_time_pct | Percentage of block group area within the travel time area |
    | [census variables] | Values for each selected census variable using standardized names |
    
    #### Technical Details:
    
    - Distance calculation uses Albers Equal Area projection (EPSG:5070) for accurate measurements across the US
    - For areas with multiple POIs, the distance to the nearest POI is used
    - Census variables use lowercase names with underscores (e.g., "total_population" instead of "B01003_001E")
    - Columns are organized in a logical order with identifiers first, followed by travel metrics and census data
    - CSV files are saved in the `output/csv/` directory with the same base filename as other outputs
    
    This feature enables deeper analysis in statistical software, spreadsheets, or other tools.

# Using the API
st.header("Advanced: Using the API")
st.markdown("""
For advanced users or programmatic access, you can use the Community Mapper as a Python library:

```python
from community_mapper import run_community_mapper

# Example with OpenStreetMap query
results = run_community_mapper(
    config_path="my_config.yaml",
    travel_time=15,
    census_variables=["total_population", "median_household_income"],
    api_key="YOUR_CENSUS_API_KEY",
    export=True  # Export to CSV (default is True)
)

# Example with custom coordinates
results = run_community_mapper(
    custom_coords_path="my_coordinates.csv",
    travel_time=15,
    census_variables=["total_population", "median_household_income"],
    api_key="YOUR_CENSUS_API_KEY",
    export=True  # Export to CSV (default is True)
)
```

The `run_community_mapper` function returns a dictionary with paths to the generated files:

```python
{
    "poi_file": "output/pois/pois_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json",
    "isochrone_file": "output/isochrones/isochrones_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.geojson",
    "block_group_file": "output/block_groups/block_groups_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.geojson",

# Troubleshooting
st.header("Troubleshooting")
st.markdown("""
### Common Issues

#### No POIs Found
- Check your query terms and location spelling
- Try broadening your search (e.g., use a more general POI type)
- Verify that the area has OSM data available

#### Census API Issues
- Ensure your API key is valid and properly set
- Check that you're not exceeding API rate limits
- Verify that the requested variables are available

#### Isochrone Generation Problems
- For very large areas, try reducing the travel time
- Check that the network is connected (islands or remote areas may cause issues)
- For large cities, consider processing smaller areas separately

#### Performance Tips
- Limit the number of POIs for faster processing
- Start with a smaller travel time to test your query
- Process one demographic variable at a time for quicker results
